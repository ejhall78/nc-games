# nc-games

## Project Summary

The purpose of this project is to provide a front-end website to allow users to interact with my nc-games API: https://be-nc-games-ejhall78.herokuapp.com/ https://github.com/ejhall78/be-nc-games

The theme of the data is board games! Users can create, read, update and delete reviews of certain board games; comments on said reviews; the users that made the comments and the game categories.

Here is a link to the app so you can try it out for yourself: https://nc-games-ejhall78.netlify.app/

Enjoy :-)

## Installation

If you want to run the app on your own machine, there are a few steps to setting it up:

- `Cloning the repo`
- `Installing dependencies`
- `Running a development server`

## Cloning the repo

- cd (change directory) into the location where you want to save this on your machine

```
cd <desired location>
```

- Press the green Code button on the repo on GitHub
- Copy the relevant link whether you are using HTTPS or SSH
- In your desired directory on your local machine, type the following and hit enter:

```
git clone <paste link from GitHub here>
```

- cd into nc-games

```
cd nc-games
```

- You have now successfully cloned the repo and may choose to open it with your code editor of choice
- Hint: if you use VSCode, type the following and press enter to open your current directory:

```
code .
```

## Installing dependencies

Now type the following and hit enter:

```
npm i
```

### Running a development server

As this is a react app, react has created a script that allows us to run a development server on our local machines

Type the following into your terminal and hit enter to open a development server on localhost:3000/

```
npm start
```

This should open a new tab in your default browser and head to localhost:3000/ where you can see the app working
